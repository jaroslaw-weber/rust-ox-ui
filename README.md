# Rust Ox Ui
High-level gui api for rust (early alpha). Ready to create simple ui, althout api may change.

# Goals
- flexible - can make different kinds of ui
- easy
- backend-agnostic, opengl on default
- serializable - creating templates
- editor mode - creating gui in editor
- possible mobile framework

# Inspirations
- Unity3d
- Flutter
- React
- Bootstrap

# Implemented
- Rectangle, Image, Text, Color, Button - components
- Easy prototyping
- Easy to serialize
- Event system (buttons only for now)
- State system (flutter/react like) - reloading only on state change

# Need to be implemented
- Window scrolling (html like view, considering mobile)
- Input Field
- Serialization
- UI Visual Editor
- Better Performance
- Less boilerplate - more similar to flutter/html experience
- Mobile
- Divide library and example project to different repositories
- Documentation
